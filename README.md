## 🧠 How Selection Works

* **DataTable** selection is row-based (`Artwork[]`)
* **CustomSelectOverlay** works with IDs (`number[]`)
* IDs are safely derived from selected rows
* TypeScript guards ensure `id` is never `undefined`

## 🐞 Common Issues

* **Red lines in TypeScript** → usually caused by `number | undefined`
* Fixed using proper type guards (`id is number`)
